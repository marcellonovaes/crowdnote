# crowdnote
CrowdNote is a crowdsourcing environment for complex video annotations without the need for trained workers or specialists. CrowdNote is based on a cascading microtasks approach to achieve complex video annotation by aggregating and processing multiple simple annotations collected from the crowd. The used approach consists of dividing complex annotation tasks into simple and small microtasks and cascading them to generate a final result. Moreover, this approach allows using simple annotation tools rather than complex and expensive annotation systems. Also, it tends to avoid activities that may be tedious and time-consuming for contributors, that are the workers in crowdsourcing scenarios.

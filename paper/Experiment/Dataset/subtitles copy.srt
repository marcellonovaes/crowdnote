Ada Lovelace was a brilliant woman that helped to develop the basis of all modern computing.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,360
She had studied mathematics and was included in the scientific circles of the 19th century.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,720
In special, she had contact with the work of Babbage and became fascinated by his machine.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,720
At a certain point Ada asked Babbage to be her tutor, but he declined it.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,840
However, Babbage recommended other great figure, Augustus DeMorgan.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:32,420
DeMorgan accepted to advise her, and influenced her with his theories about logical relations and properties.

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,400
DeMorgan taught her some formalism and opened her mind to other points of view.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:45,000
Based on that, Ada wrote her Notes about the Babbage Analytics Engine, and these Notes were published in 1843.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,040
In this work she described the main logical structures still used nowadays in computers programming.

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,920
Few years later George Boole created his binary algebra system.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,940
In 1937, Turing published a work describing his universal computer

12
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,800
and Claude Shannon described how circuits of switches can perform Boolean tasks.

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,020
At this point all theory was developed and the scientists were ready to design the first computers.

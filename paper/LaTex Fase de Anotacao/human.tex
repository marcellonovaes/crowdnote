The presented method is based on the human computation paradigm \citep{VonAhn:2005:HC:1168246}, using a crowdsourcing approach \citep{Howe2006} to annotate media objects. To do so, this method employs some fundamental concepts commonly associated with human computation. These concepts are presented in this section.
%, and it is explained how they are incorporated into the method.

%Its goal is to generate complex annotations without the need for experts nor sophisticated annotation tools. In this method, complex annotations are generated by a composition of simple annotation tasks, which must be modeled so that they can be performed by individuals from a crowd of workers.

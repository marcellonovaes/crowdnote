Media annotation consists of supplementing media objects, such as videos, images, and audios, by adding metadata about their content and context, also to describing media characteristics such as quality, encoding, among other features. Complex media annotation involves annotating different aspects of media objects as well as relating them. This kind of annotation usually is associated with a demanding process that requires experts and elaborated annotation system. This paper presents a method to achieve complex media annotation without requiring complex tools, experts nor trained workers. In this method, the complex annotation process is divided into a set of simple annotation microtasks, and based on them is defined a process workflow for generating complex annotation. To demonstrate the operation of this method, we developed a video enrichment system and carried out an experiment in which the crowd was responsible for executing a set of simple annotation microtasks through simple tools.
